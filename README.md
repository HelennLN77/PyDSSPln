# PyDSSPln - DSSP implementation project
This project is an implementation of the DSSP ( Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins) algorithm. Its role is to parse an input Protein Data Bank ( PDB) file to determine the secondary structure of proteins (helices, sheets) The projects aims to imlemente the DSSP algorithm and output the results in .mkdssp format. It can be used to study the protein structures and compare the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity with the offical DSSP toom from the BioPython library.
